<h1> LETS BRIEFLY LEARN ABOUT EACH OF THE ABOVE TOPICS</H1>

<h2> What are paintings? </h2>
    <h3>Painting is the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium to a surface (support base). The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush,
    but other implements, such as knives, sponges, and airbrushes,can be used.</h3>

<h2> What are prints ?</h2>
    <h3>A print is a two-dimensional art form created by an impression made by a method involving a transfer from one surface to anotherAll type of prints come in multiples
    (except monotypes) to form an edition. Since the late 19th century, artists tend to identify each print with a number and signature.
     It is common practice for the maker to produce a limited edition of the image, which means there is a fixed quantity.The tools used to create the print are often
     destroyed once the edition has been completed.</h3>

<h2>What are drawings?</h2>
<h3>As with paintings, drawings are one of the oldest art forms around and can be traced back to prehistoric times. Before the advent of paper in the 14th century,
    drawings were made on parchment and silver was also used to make under-drawings.Drawing was and still is a popular method for artists to create preparatory studies.
    Examples of preparatory work are often a good way to see the artist's initial observations and ideas before they commit to the final markings in their work.</h3>

<h2> What is photography?</h2>
<h3>A photograph is an image created by the exposure of light on a light-sensitive material at some stage during its making.  It can be either a positive or negative
    image and made using one of many processes.As with prints, photographic prints are often produced in a limited edition and each photographic print is signed and
    numbered.</h3>
<h2> What is craft?</h2>
<h3>The art of craft-making can be defined as an occupation or trade which involves manual dexterity and skilled artistry. A significant advent for the crafts was the
    'Arts and Crafts Movement' which flourished in the late 19th and early 20th century. The focus was on good design and craftsmanship at a time when there was increased
    mechanisation and mass production.</h3>

<h2>What is a design?</h2>
<h3>Part of applied arts, design comes in many forms, from graphic, fashion, interior, functional to the industrial. Design, in the context of displays in galleries, can
    be found in objects such as furniture and lighting, but also in the photographic and limited edition prints where graphic design has been used.</h3>

<h2> What is performance art?</h2>
<h3>Peformance Art is where the artwork takes the form of actions performed by the artist/s or approved performers briefed by the artist.In Europe, the German artist Joseph Beuys
    was a hugely influential pioneer of Performance art, making a wide impact with his 'actions' from 1963 onwards. At around the same time in the UK, it was the artist duo
    Gilbert & George taking the scene by storm.</h3>

<h2>What is mixed media? </h2>
<h3>Mixed-media tends to refer to artworks that use a combination of materials in their construction. For example, a work on canvas that combines paint and ink as well as collage.
    The use of mixed media can be seen to be rooted in the Cubist Collages and constructions of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. 
    The choosing and application of various materials with mixed media works is essential in creating quality and integrity in the piece.
    Artists working in mixed media are afforded a great deal of creative freedom. For example, found objects can be used in conjunction with more conventional media, such as paint and
    graphite, challenging our preconceptions about the materials which can be used in the making of works of art.</h3>

<h2> What is a sculpture?</h3>
<h3>As with painting, the earliest example of sculpture dates back to the Upper Paleolithic period (40,000 to 10,000 years ago). During this period stone and ivory were used to create
    small female figures.  It wasn't until the Greeks used bronze casting that life size figures were represented in sculpture.
    Technically, sculptures are for the most part three-dimensional artworks created by shaping and moulding materials - typically marble, metal, glass, wood and bronze.  A
    two-dimensional form of sculpture exists, where the object is not fully detached from its background, which is described as relief carving.  Often relief carving is used to depict
    a scene with many figures interacting on a detailed landscape. Sculpture is often painted, but commonly loses its paint over time.</h3>

<h2>What is installaton?</h2>
<h3>The term installation was coined in the 1970s to describe artwork that of any form or size that inhibits a space inside or outside a gallery, which is often site-specific. 
    Installations are typically three-dimensional and can be made up by a variety of material and medium. They can be indefinite or temporary and viewers can find themselves walking
    around a piece, contemplating it from a distance or immersing themselves in the space of the work itself. 
    It is common for installations to be specially commissioned for sites.  If someone is interested in buying a site-specific installation an artist may be willing to adapt the 
    original for a new setting or create a similar piece.</h3>
